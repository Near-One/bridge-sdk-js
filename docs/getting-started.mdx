This guide walks you through bridging USDC from Ethereum to NEAR. By the end, you'll understand the pattern that works for all chains.

## Install

```bash
npm install @omni-bridge/core @omni-bridge/evm
```

## The Pattern

Every transfer follows three steps:

1. **Validate** — Check that addresses, amounts, and tokens are valid
2. **Build** — Get an unsigned transaction for the source chain
3. **Sign & Send** — Use your wallet or library to broadcast

```typescript
import { createBridge, ChainKind } from "@omni-bridge/core"
import { createEvmBuilder } from "@omni-bridge/evm"
import { createWalletClient, http } from "viem"
import { mainnet } from "viem/chains"
import { privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts"

// Setup
const bridge = createBridge({ network: "mainnet" })
const evm = createEvmBuilder({ network: "mainnet", chain: ChainKind.Eth })

const account = privateKeyToAccount("0x...")
const wallet = createWalletClient({
  chain: mainnet,
  transport: http(),
  account,
})

// 1. Validate the transfer
const validated = await bridge.validateTransfer({
  token: "eth:0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48", // USDC on Ethereum
  amount: 1_000_000n, // 1 USDC (6 decimals)
  sender: `eth:${account.address}`,
  recipient: "near:alice.near",
  fee: 0n,
  nativeFee: 0n,
})

// 2. Approve the bridge to spend your tokens (ERC20 only)
const approval = evm.buildApproval(
  "0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48",
  1_000_000n
)
await wallet.sendTransaction(approval)

// 3. Build and send the transfer
const tx = evm.buildTransfer(validated)
const hash = await wallet.sendTransaction(tx)

console.log("Transfer initiated:", hash)
```

That's it. The transfer is now in progress. Relayers will finalize it on NEAR within a few minutes.

## What Just Happened

Let's break down the key parts:

### OmniAddress Format

Addresses include a chain prefix so the SDK knows which chain they belong to:

```typescript
"eth:0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48"  // Token on Ethereum
"near:alice.near"                                   // Account on NEAR
"sol:EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v" // Token on Solana
```

See [OmniAddress Format](/core-concepts/omni-addresses) for the full list.

### Validation

`validateTransfer()` does the heavy lifting:

- Checks that addresses are valid for their chains
- Verifies the token is registered on the bridge
- Ensures the amount survives [decimal normalization](/core-concepts/decimals)
- Returns a `ValidatedTransfer` object the builders need

### Unsigned Transactions

`buildTransfer()` returns a plain object — not a signed transaction:

```typescript
{
  to: "0x...",      // Bridge contract
  data: "0x...",    // Encoded function call
  value: 0n,        // Native token amount (for ETH transfers)
  chainId: 1        // Ethereum mainnet
}
```

This works directly with viem's `sendTransaction()` or ethers' `signer.sendTransaction()`.

## Using Testnet

For development, switch to testnet:

```typescript
const bridge = createBridge({ network: "testnet" })
const evm = createEvmBuilder({ network: "testnet", chain: ChainKind.Eth })
```

Testnet uses Sepolia for Ethereum. Make sure your wallet and RPC are configured for the right network.

## Track Your Transfer

Check the status using the API client:

```typescript
import { BridgeAPI } from "@omni-bridge/core"

const api = new BridgeAPI("mainnet")
const status = await api.getTransferStatus({ transactionHash: hash })

console.log("Current status:", status[status.length - 1])
// "Initialized" → "Signed" → "FinalisedOnNear" → "Finalised"
```

See [Tracking Transfers](/guides/tracking) for polling patterns and status meanings.
