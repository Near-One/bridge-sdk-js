description: TypeScript SDK for cross-chain token transfers
---

The Omni Bridge SDK lets you build cross-chain token transfers into your application. It handles the complex parts — address validation, amount encoding, fee calculation — and gives you back unsigned transactions to sign and broadcast however you like.

## What It Does

You tell the SDK where tokens should go. It figures out the rest:

- Validates addresses across different chain formats
- Normalizes token amounts between different decimal precisions
- Encodes transactions for the bridge contracts
- Calculates fees for relayer-assisted finalization

The SDK is **library agnostic**. It returns plain transaction objects that work with viem, ethers, @solana/web3.js, near-kit, or whatever signing solution you prefer.

## Supported Chains

  <Card title="EVM" icon="ethereum">
    Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Polygon, BNB Chain
  </Card>
  <Card title="NEAR" icon="circle-nodes">
    NEAR Protocol
  </Card>
  <Card title="Solana" icon="sun">

  </Card>

## Packages

Install everything with the umbrella package, or just the chains you need:

```bash
# Everything
npm install @omni-bridge/sdk

# Just EVM chains
npm install @omni-bridge/core @omni-bridge/evm

# Just NEAR
npm install @omni-bridge/core @omni-bridge/near
```

| Package | What it's for |
|---------|---------------|
| `@omni-bridge/core` | Validation, types, API client (always needed) |
| `@omni-bridge/evm` | Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Polygon, BNB |
| `@omni-bridge/near` | NEAR Protocol |
| `@omni-bridge/solana` | Solana |
| `@omni-bridge/btc` | Bitcoin, Zcash |
| `@omni-bridge/sdk` | Re-exports everything |
