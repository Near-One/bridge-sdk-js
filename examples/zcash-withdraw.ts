/**
 * Bitcoin Withdrawal Example
 *
 * Simple example showing how to withdraw Zcash from NEAR using the Omni Bridge SDK.
 *
 * Setup:
 * 1. Replace NEAR_ACCOUNT with your testnet account
 * 2. Replace BITCOIN_ADDRESS with your Bitcoin testnet address
 * 3. Ensure you have nBTC balance and NEAR credentials in ~/.near-credentials
 *
 * Usage: bun run examples/bitcoin-withdraw.ts
